"Good afternoon.

Kansas State Department of Education staff conducted a search of all KSDE email accounts for the use of the word “bible” since January 1, 2022. That search found 12,034 emails that include the word “bible”. The Ten Commandments appears over 700 times. The agency does not have the resources or ability to search through all of those emails to determine if they are responsive to your request or if they were emails talking about something completely unrelated therefore your request is denied as authorized by K.S.A. 45-218(e) because finding said records places an unreasonable burden on the agency.

I have confirmed with agency leadership that no discussions have taken place within the last two years, nor is there any movement toward purchasing or placing any religious materials such as the Holy Bible or the Ten Commandments in Kansas public schools by either the Kansas State Department of Education or the State Board of Education.

"Dear P. S. Sai,
This is in final response to your 23-Oct-24 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for Dear Air Force,

""On behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records: 1. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024. This request is expressly limited to Air Force's own FOIA office.

Your request as submitted does not sufficiently describe a Department of the Air Force (DAF) record. The request is not “perfected” because it does not ask for any DAF subject matter agency record dealing with the Air Force business. Under 5 U.S. Code § 552, the FOIA specifies requirements for an access request, specifically that a request for agency records must ""reasonably describe"" the records sought. See 5 U.S.C. § 552 (a)(3)(A). A description of a requested record is sufficient if it enables a professional agency employee familiar with the subject area to locate the record with a “reasonable amount of effort.” See Truitt v. Dep’t of State, 897 F.2d 540, 544-45 (D.C. Cir. 1990); see also Ferri v. Dep’t of Just., 573 F. Supp. 852, 859 (W.D. Pa. 1983).

As such, after careful review of your request, we are administratively closing it as it does not meet the requirements under the FOIA. Please note that the FOIA does not require agencies to answer questions or interrogatories; analyze and/or interpret documents for a requester; create records; conduct research; initiate investigations; or provide statutes, regulations, publications, or other documents that are otherwise made available to the public.

Should you decide to appeal this decision, you must write to the Secretary of the Air Force, Through: SAF/AAII (FOIA), 1000 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1000 within 90 calendar days from the date of this letter. Include in the appeal your reasons for reconsideration and attach a copy of this letter.

If you are dissatisfied with the servicing of this request or this final response from this office, you may contact the Air Force FOIA Public Liaison Officer, Mr. Robert Bivins, concerning this response at AF FOIA Public Liaison Office (SAF/CIO A6XA), 1800 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1800, usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.af-foia@mail.mil or (703) 614-8500. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.

Please contact this office at the address above, via email at SAF.AA.HAF.FOIA.Workflow@us.af.mil, should you have any questions and refer to case AF 2025-00548-F. Department of Defense Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Manual 33-302 indicates fees may be assessed for processing this request; however, there are no applicable fees in this instance.

************************************************************************

A message was sent to you regarding record request #24-58:

Your request is very broad and involves several different departments on post. It will take a substantial amount of time to access, search for, and compile responsive records. State law allows for agencies to ""make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost."" The Virginia FOIA Advisory Council, in their ""FOIA Charges Guide,"" says staff costs ""should be based on the hourly rate of salary for administrative or support staff."" Actual costs of fulfilling a FOIA request are always more than what a requester pays since VMI does not charge for all the expenses allowable by law.

What was provided to you was an estimate of staff time involved in accessing, searching, reviewing, and redacting (if necessary) any responsive records. Your final invoice may be less (or more) based on the actual time it takes the staff involved to fulfill your request.

Whether responsive records exist in electronic format is irrelevant. Each record is reviewed to determine if the record is responsive, are not exempt from disclosure, and may be disclosed without violating other provisions of law. This is where most of the FOIA officer's time is spent. Given the breadth of your request, the volume of responsive records will determine the amount of time the FOIA officer spends reviewing records. (Secondary legal review of responsive records is not an allowable charge.)

"Dear requestor,

Our office denies the request. We received a copy of Kent Hoover’s Tennessee driver license. But having reviewed the correspondence concerning the request, it appears that this request is not coming from Mr. Hoover. And our office has not received proof of citizenship from the requestor. I have previously communicated directly with Mr. Kent Hoover, and he may of course choose to make a public records request to our office consistent with the Tennessee Public Records Act and the Tennessee Department of State Public Records Policy.

Given this basis for denial, our office has not addressed any other issued concerning this request.

RE: Need More Information - EPA FOIA Request Number 2025-EPA-01060

Hello Kristen Axtman:

This email concerns the above-referenced Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National FOIA Office (NFO) on 11/07/2024. You are seeking the following: ""I hereby request the following records: All communications, which may include, but should not be limited to, emails, correspondence, memos, and transcriptions of telephone calls, containing the words 'Forest Degradation.'""

After review of your FOIA request, we determined your request does not reasonably describe the records you are seeking in a way that will permit EPA employees to identify and locate them.  For example, as submitted your request is overly broad and does not include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter. For your request for communications containing the words ""Forest Degradation,"" please clarify which EPA staff and/or program offices you are requesting communications for. Additionally, please clarify the date range that you are requesting a search of records for. While the Freedom of Information Act does not require you to explain the reason for your request for records, if you can provide clarifying information on the purpose of your request, this will also support the agency with narrowing the scope of the search to identify records that you are seeking.

EPA’s FOIA regulations state: “Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter. If known, the requester should include any file designations or descriptions for the records that the requester wants. The more specific the requester is about the records or type of records that the requester wants, the more likely EPA will be able to identify and locate records responsive to the request.” 40 C.F.R 2.102 (c) The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify reasonably described records

We would like to provide you with the opportunity to clarify the records that you are seeking so that EPA can process your request.  As indicated in 40 C.F.R. § 2.102(c), please include any specific information about the records, including time period, authors, or a more detailed description of the records' subject matter.  Please contact Lee Hagy at hagy.lee@epa.gov with your clarification or let us know if you would like to schedule a time to discuss your request over the phone.
. If we do not hear back from you, EPA may issue a final determination to close out your request. Please note that you are not prohibited from submitting additional Freedom of Information Act requests in the future. Please reply within 20 calendar days from the date of this email by November 28, 2024

For more information, please visit our website at: https://www.epa.gov/foia. If you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, you may seek assistance from EPA’s FOIA Public Liaison at hq.foia@epa.gov or call (202) 566-1667. You may also seek assistance from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).

"I have received your request for records under the Alabama Open Records Law § 36-12-40 et seq.

The FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) as a matter of clarification is a federal provision that is primarily concerned with the several federal agencies and making certain information is public and available, but that act does not have applicability to state and local entities. Section 36-12-40, commonly referred to as the Alabama Open Records Law, states that “every citizen (now RESIDENT) has a right to inspect and take a copy of any public writing of this state, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.” It is therefore axiomatic that an Alabama statute that references the rights of a citizen denotes the rights of a person who is a resident of this state.

The Alabama Supreme Court has limited the import of section 36-12-40 to Alabama citizens. See State ex rel Kernells v. Ezell, 291 Ala. 440. (Ala.1973). Also, in Stone v. Consol. Publ’g Co., 404 So. 2d 678, 681 (1981) which states that public writings of the state are records that record the activities of public officers so that the status or condition of …activities can be known by our citizens (RESIDENTS). The United States Supreme Court in McBurney v. Young, 133 S. Ct. 1709, 1714 (2013) ruled that a state’s public records law limited access to public records to only the citizens of that state. Therefore, Alabama Attorney General Opinion 2018-030 has concluded that generally, access to public records is limited to requests by Alabama citizens only. Muckrock is not a resident citizen of Alabama.

Accordingly, we are unable to fulfill your request.

************************************************************************

Record request #24-1428 has been closed. The closure reason supplied was:

The City of Providence does not maintain documents responsive to this request. The state's master jury list is likely maintained by the State of Rhode Island.

In accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-8, you may wish to appeal this decision to the Chief Administrative Officer. In this instance, Jeff Dana, City Solicitor, fulfills that role. You may also wish to file a complaint with the Department of the Attorney General or the Rhode Island Superior Court.

"To Whom It May Concern:

Your October 22, 2024 emailed request for information directed to Assistant State Court Administrator Alexandra E. Kriss has been referred to this office for review and response. In your email, you seek two (2) categories of materials “regarding the compilation and composition of the state’s master jury list.”

These requests are governed by the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act (the “APRA”), G.L. 1956 §§ 38-2-1 et seq. The APRA permits access to “public records” in the possession of Rhode Island state agencies as that term is defined in the statute. See G.L. 1956 § 38-2-1; § 38-2-3(a). The term “public records” is defined in G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4) to encompass a wide variety of records. However, § 38-2-2(4) also lists many types of records that “shall not be deemed public” and are, therefore, exempt or otherwise excluded from disclosure under the APRA.

With these background principles in mind, responses to your requests are as follows.

· Request #1: “All current policies and procedures regarding how the current master jury list was compiled and how often master jury lists are reviewed and updated. Please name all source lists (driver’s license records, voter registration lists, etc) that were utilized in creating the current master jury list.”

· Response #1: Please be advised that the Judiciary does not maintain any documents responsive to this request. Accordingly, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 38-2-7(c) please be advised that the Judiciary cannot fulfill this request on the ground that it is not in possession of any responsive records. See Howard v. RI DEM, 2018 WL 6074350, at *2 (R.I.A.G. Nov. 5, 2018); see also G.L. 1956 § 38-2-3(h).

I respectfully suggest you consult Title 9, Chapter 9 of the Rhode Island General Laws, which sets forth the statutory scheme applicable to the compilation of jury lists in Rhode Island. Title 9, Chapter 9 of the General Laws may be accessed for free here: https://webserver.rilegislature.gov//Statutes/TITLE9/9-9/INDEX.htm<https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/Statutes/TITLE9/9-9/INDEX.htm>.

· Request #2: “All reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding the composition of the current master jury list. Please include the total number of individuals on the current master jury list and all relevant demographic data, including but not limited to the race, age and gender of individuals that comprise the current master jury list.”

· Response #2: Please be advised that the Judiciary does not maintain any records containing “relevant demographic data, including but not limited to the race, age and gender of individuals that comprise the current master jury list.” Accordingly, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 38-2-7(c) please be advised that the Judiciary cannot fulfill this portion of your request on the ground that it is not in possession of any responsive records. See Howard, 2018 WL 6074350 at *2; see also G.L. 1956 § 38-2-3(h).

With regard to your request for “reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding the composition of the current master jury list” as well as for “the total number of individuals on the current master jury list,” please be advised that certain jury roll information may be obtained directly from the Office of the Jury Commissioner. The Jury Commissioner may be reached at (401) 222-5879.

Notwithstanding, it is the determination of this office that the APRA is not the proper vehicle through which to request this information pursuant to several statutory exceptions. First, the information you request is exempt from disclosure pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(T), which states that the APRA applies to judicial bodies “only in respect to their administrative function.” The composition, management, and maintenance of juror rolls is not administrative but, rather, pertains to a core adjudicative function of the judicial branch of government pursuant to the jury’s central role in the administration of justice in Rhode Island since its founding. See Article I, § 10 and § 15 of the Rhode Island Constitution; Advisory Opinion to Senate, 108 R.I. 628, 631-41, 278 A.2d 852, 853-59 (1971); In re Opinion to the Governor, 62 R.I. 200, 4 A.2d 487, 487-91 (1939). Accordingly, the APRA does not apply to documentation related thereto See Caldwell v. RITT, 2021 WL 4202803, at *3 (R.I.A.G. Aug. 2, 2021); Ritchotte v. Town of Coventry, 2017 WL 4157664, at *2 (R.I.A.G. Aug. 18, 2017). Moreover, because this information is wholly non-public, no reasonably segregable portion or portions are disclosable. See G.L. 1956 § 38-2-3(b).

Second, G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(S) exempts from disclosure “[r]ecords, reports, opinions, information, and statements required to be kept confidential by federal law or regulation or state law or rule of court.” The master jury roll in Rhode Island is composed of information received from several sources—local boards of canvassers, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Revenue, and the Department of Labor and Training. See G.L. 1956 § 9-9-1. Such records are all individually required to be kept confidential pursuant to state law. See G.L. 1956 §§ 17-9.1-6 and 17-28-9 (voter registrations); G.L. 1956 § 31-10.4-3 (driver’s license/state I.D. card records); G.L. 1956 § 44-58-6 (taxpayer information); G.L. 1956 § 28-39-19 and 28-42-38 (unemployment records). Therefore, the information you seek is separately exempt from disclosure under this exception as well. See Sinapi v. BHDDH, 2023 WL 2717803, at *3-*4 (R.I.A.G. Feb. 6, 2023) (determining that BHDDH properly withheld certain documentation from disclosure because the records were considered confidential and non-public under G.L. 1956 § 40.1-24-12). Again, because such information is wholly non-public, no reasonably segregable portion or portions are disclosable. See G.L. 1956 § 38-2-3(b).

Finally, the records you seek are also independently except from disclosure pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(A)(I)(b), which excludes from the definition of “public records” those “[p]ersonnel and other personal individually identifiable records otherwise deemed confidential by federal or state law or regulation, or the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq. . . . .” “The plain language of this provision contemplates a ‘balancing test’ whereby the public interest in disclosure is weighed against any privacy interest . . . to determine whether the disclosure of the requested records, in whole or in part, ‘would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.’” Burke v. City of Warwick, 2022 WL 1207487, at *2 (R.I.A.G. Mar. 9, 2022) (quoting G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(A)(I)(b)). This test requires the balancing of “the public’s right to ‘[o]fficial information that sheds light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties,’ against the privacy interests implicated by disclosure.” Collette v. Town of Hopkinton, 2016 WL 499007, at *5 (R.I.A.G. Feb. 2, 2016).

Here, the balancing test does not favor disclosure.",denial

Re: Open Records Request Related to Elijah Vue Investigation

Dear Mr. David Yupa,

The City of Two Rivers is in receipt of your Public Records Request dated October 24, 2024. This letter serves as the City’s response to your open records request in which you requested “any and all records and materials related to the case of Suspect Name: Jesse Vang.” For the reasons explained in detail below, the City is unable to grant you access to the above described records.

Your request seeks the disclosure of information and records pertaining to an ongoing criminal investigation and prosecution. Wisconsin law specifically exempts records related to a criminal prosecution from disclosure, even once the prosecution is complete. State ex rel. Richards v. Foust, 165 Wis. 2d 429, 433-34, 477 N.W.2d 608 (1991). Investigations and data and information collected for investigation are exempt from disclosure. Id. at 435-36. Furthermore, documents integral to the criminal investigation and prosecution processes are specifically protected from public inspection. See State ex rel. Davis v. Chisholm, 2008 WI App 51, 309 Wis. 2d 235, 747 N.W.2d 528; and see State ex rel. Lafaive v. Records Custodian Waukesha Cty. DA, 2023 WI App 32, 408 Wis. 2d 543, 993 N.W.2d 180.

As such, given that this matter is currently pending criminal investigation and prosecution, the City of Two Rivers is unable to complete your request to the extent that it requests investigatory records. Additionally, the records you request also include crime victim information exempt from disclosure by the Wisconsin Constitution. The Wisconsin Constitution specifically provides: “This state shall treat crime victims, as defined by law, with fairness, dignity and respect for their privacy.” Wis. Const. art. I, § 9m. This policy is further embodied in Wis. Stat. § 950.04(1v)(ag), governing rights of crime victims, and Wis. Stat. § 950.055(1), governing rights of juvenile crime victims.

Applying the constitution and these statutes, Wisconsin courts recognize “that justice requires that all who are engaged in the prosecution of crimes make every effort to minimize further suffering by crime victims.” Schilling v. Crime Victims Rights Bd., 2005 WI 17, 26, 278 Wis. 2d 216, 692 N.W.2d 623. Here, Wisconsin courts have made it clear that the public policy interest in protecting the privacy of victims of crime—especially children affected by very sensitive crimes—“weighs heavily in favor of nondisclosure.” Democratic Party of Wis. v. Wis. DOJ, 2016 WI 100, ¶14, 372 Wis. 2d 460, 888 N.W.2d 584. Pursuant to this, the City of Two Rivers is unable to release information that would compromise the privacy of the deceased child.

As a result of these two exceptions to Wisconsin's open records law, the City of Two Rivers is unable to complete your request at this time.

Respectfully,
[Signature]

Dear Taylor Amarel:

Due to the transition to SecureRelease, a new Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) processing system, and an unprecedented growth in the number of FOIA requests submitted to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), we are reviewing our cases to ensure the most efficient processing of backlogged FOIA requests.

Given the amount of time that has passed since the filing of your request, we are reaching out to determine whether you are still interested in pursuing your request for records in FOIA Case CBP-2018-068405, in which you requested All emails sent to, from, or copied to Kevin McAleenan (Customs and Border Protection Commissioner) from May 26, 2018 to Present Day containing any of the following non-case-sensitive key-strings: ""EB-5"", ""Amarel"", ""Whistleblower"", ""stephen miller"", ""broken families"", ""resignation"", ""kushner"", ""prosecution"", ""suspension"" or ""family separation""..

If you are no longer interested, then no further action is required.

You may also contact us to withdraw your case. This will help ensure that other requests are not delayed unnecessarily by expending limited time and resources on a request that is no longer of interest.

If you are still interested in pursuing your FOIA request, please send an email to CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, at cbpfoiapublicliaison@cbp.dhs.gov or mail a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or call 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150.)
Please be advised that if you are still interested in these records, CBP FOIA may need to reach out to you for a narrowed search as such emails may produce several ""non-responsive"" attachments and news clippings.

In the subject line, please notate file number CBP-2018-068405 and “Still Interested” on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request.

This is not a denial of your request. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed as withdrawn.

Sincerely,

FOIA Division

The City is in receipt of the below public records request and it will be forwarded to the appropriate department(s) for a response to determine if such a record(s) exists. All City records are open for personal inspection and copying by any person except for portions of records which contain exempt or confidential information which may not be disclosed unless otherwise permitted by law.  While the City strives to provide access to public records by remote electronic means, it is necessary that the records are reviewed for possible exempt or confidential information prior to disclosure.  Should the records contain exempt or confidential information that is required to be redacted, the City will need to bill for the time expended on making the necessary redactions.  Should any extraordinary time be required, the City charges administrative fees as authorized by Florida Statutes.  An estimate of charges will be provided for prepayment prior to work being processed.

Your record request #24-455 has been submitted successfully.

Your records request has been received and forwarded to the appropriate staff member for review. 

You will be notified within (10) days whether your request seeks copies of disclosable public records in the possession of this agency. In most cases, your request will be processed in two to four weeks, or sooner. 

The City may invoke an extension of time to determine if there is a need to:

* Search for and collect the requested records from field facilities.

* Search for and examine a voluminous number of records.

* Consult with another agency or City departments having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.

* Compile data.

If your request is to review records (rather than receive copies), an appointment will be made with you for review once the records are gathered.  Please note:  If any responsive documents are copyrighted they can only be viewed in house.  No duplicate or photos are allowed.

There is a charge for the direct cost of duplication pursuant to the City’s Book of fees. Payment must be made prior to release of records requested. If the documents requested exceed 50 pages, a deposit may be requested.

Records available for review and/or copies of records requested will be available for 10 days after notification of their availability.

Certain records are generally exempt for disclosure pursuant to Government Code Section 6255, where the public interest served by not making the records public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the records. The Government Code further provides that certain other records are specifically exempt from disclosure.

Re: 2025-HQFO-00639

Dear Requester:

This letter acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), dated 10/22/2024, and to your request for a waiver of all assessable FOIA fees. Our office received your request on 10/22/2024. Specifically, you requested

1. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.
2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.
3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.
4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024..

Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 § 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, the Department processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although DHS’ goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances under 6 C.F.R. Part 5 § 5.5(c).

You have requested a fee waiver. The DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 § 5.11(k) set forth six factors DHS must evaluate to determine whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met: (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government,” (2) Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities, (3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons, (4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be “significant,” (5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure, and (6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requester is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

Upon review of the subject matter of your request, and an evaluation of the six factors identified above, DHS has determined that it will conditionally grant your request for a fee waiver. The fee waiver determination will be based upon a sampling of the responsive documents received from the various DHS program offices as a result of the searches conducted in response to your FOIA request. DHS will, pursuant to DHS FOIA regulations applicable to non-commercial requesters, provide two hours of search time and process the first 100 pages at no charge to you. If upon review of these documents, DHS determines that the disclosure of the information contained in those documents does not meet the factors permitting DHS to waive the fees, then DHS will at that time either deny your request for a fee waiver entirely, or will allow for a percentage reduction in the amount of the fees corresponding to the amount of relevant material found that meets the factors allowing for a fee waiver. In either case, DHS will promptly notify you of its final decision regarding your request for a fee waiver and provide you with the responsive records as required by applicable law.

In the event that your fee waiver is denied, and you determine that you still want the records, provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters. As a non-commercial requester you will be charged for any search time and duplication beyond the free two hours and 100 pages mentioned in the previous paragraph. You will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication and search time at the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher. In the event that your fee waiver is denied, we will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. This office will contact you before accruing any additional fees.

We have queried the appropriate component(s) of DHS for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the analysts in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.

Your request has been assigned reference number 2025-HQFO-00639. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please feel free to contact this office at 1-866-431-0486 or 202-343-1743.",other
"Hi Mr. Sai:

The purpose of this email is to obtain clarification on the above-referenced FOIA request which was received in our office on October 22, 2024. Your request sought the following:

1. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.
2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.
3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.
4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.

In your original request you stated the following:

“This request is expressly limited to Department of Homeland Security's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division.”

We understand this statement to mean that the records responsive to this request are confined to the DHS Office of Privacy, where the Chief FOIA Officer for DHS is located. Additionally, there is only one designated individual in this position at DHS. Please confirm that this interpretation is correct by November 26, 2024.

If confirmed, we will proceed with processing the response to this request. This also means that similar requests sent to other DHS components will be administratively closed, as our office would be the only one with records responsive to this request.

If we do not receive a response by this date, we will proceed as stated above.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

"""Hi Sai:

I'm just following up on this request. We are currently processing our response to your request based on the clarification you provided in a previous email.

However, I wanted to just confirm that you only are interested in the Chief FOIA Officer's communication. The reason I wanted to confirm this is because no other DHS FOIA office would have records for this request because there is only one Chief FOIA officer for the entire department. My office is currently working on that response. Please confirm.

Thanks

"Dear Alessandro Guzman
The City of San Bruno Received your request for records under the California Public Records Act (Public Records Act), dated September 23, 2024, requesting the City to produce records listed below regarding the following four software programs:

* Thompson Reuters Clear
* LexisNexis Accurint
* TransUnion TLOxp
* SoundThinking Crime Tracer, which was formerly a product called COPLINKX

In accordance with Government Code Section 7922.530(a), this letter serves as the City’s disclosure of responsive records subject to release in response to your request.

The City has records responsive to your request and hereby provides those records to you. Please note the City has withheld information containing, in part, certain personal identifying information because that information is exempt from disclosure under Section 7922.000 of the California Government Code, as the public interest served in not disclosing the information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.

The City is continuing to search for and review additional potentially responsive records. In particular, the City is searching for the LexisNexis Accruint agreement and any invoices for LexisNexis. Besides LexisNexis, this disclosure comprehensively lists the requested software programs the City uses.

We estimate that we will be able to provide you with responsive records on or before November 14, 2024. If we require additional time, we will let you know as soon as possible. As always, the City’s goal is to comply promptly with any such requests and we will endeavor to respond earlier if possible.

CBP-FO-2025-011200

Dear P.S. Sai:

A search of CBP databases produced records responsive to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request CBP-FO-2025-011200, requesting records maintained by CBP.

CBP has determined that the responsive records are partially releasable, pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. § 552 and have applied the appropriate exemptions notated below:

Exemption Summary:
(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C)

Pursuant to DHS Instruction 262-11-004, FOIA Officers at DHS have been instructed to withhold personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) of DHS personnel unless a determination is made that the disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns, or if those concerns are outweighed by any public interest in that information. This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department.

For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.

You may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record.
The following item(s) also apply to your request:

• Approximately [ 0 ] pages were withheld in their entirety.
• Fees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed.
• Other: No records exist for the spam or outgoing folders.

This completes the CBP response to your request. You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency’s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2025-011200 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request.

If you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition. Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. §5.8. Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal. You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to: FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177. Your envelope and letter should be marked ""FOIA Appeal."" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf.

Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal.

This is in response to your November 17, 2024 Freedom of Information Act

Israeli governments related to the December 1980 payment of $6,000,000 as
compensation for damage to the USS Liberty caused by the June 8, 1967
attack on the ship by Israel Defense Force jet fighters and torpedo boats.

Your FOIA request was received by my office on November 20, 2024 and

Although we located the series Record Group 59 Entry UD-UP 97 General

we were not able to locate pertinent correspondence between the governments
of the United States and Israel.

Given that the State Department central file records dating from January 1,

it is possible that the correspondence you seek remains in the custody of
the Department of State. Access to those records may be requested
by contacting the Department of State FOIA Office at:
https://foia.state.gov/Contact/Default.aspx

If the Department of State transferred series to the National Archives that
include relevant records, please ask them to provide an accession or
transfer number.

We do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request. However, if you are
not satisfied with our actions, your options for appeal and dispute
resolution are outlined in the attachment.

This concludes the processing of your FOIA request by the National Archives.

textual archival records.

That office will assign your request a tracking number and respond directly
